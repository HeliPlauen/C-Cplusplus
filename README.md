# C-Cplusplus.

In this repository I located my educational tasks made using C C++
A few comments:


- CS50:

-- 3-3-recize: here located the resizing bmp-files program (the program that creates an enlarged copy of the selected image)
(to run: ./a.exe {scaling factor} chosen-file.bmp enlarged-copy.bmp)

-- 3-4-recover: here located the recovering jpeg-files program after they have been deleted from memory-card (the memory-card simulator used instead) 
(to run: ./a.exe card.raw)

-- 4-1-speller: here is only one file was created by me - dictionary.c and the other ones were my output data. The task was to create the program downloading the large English (or any other) dictionary, creating its hash-table. It gives the opportunity to check - are some words in the dictionary or not? This task was completed using pointers.


- Algorithms/Karatsuba: here located files multiplying long numbers using Karatsuba method.
